# Bundles

This directory contains bundles for assembling "gs-tar" files to add into the Grey Hack game.  They use the [`ghtar.py`](../bin/ghtar.py) Python program to construct the bundle, and the [`make`](../src/make.src) Grey Hack script to unpack.

The [documentation](../bundle-files.md) describes the file format.

The [instructions](../README.md#import-files-into-the-game) describes how to setup the make program and to import bundles into the game.
